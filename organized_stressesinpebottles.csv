ABSTRACT,"A commercial blow-molding grade, high-density polyethyl-
ene resin was employed to produce cylindrical bottles in a
commercial reciprocating screw-extrusion blow-molding ma-
chine. The distributions of thickness, crystallinity, birefrin-
gence, and impact strength were obtained at various positions.
The thickness is greatest near the parting lines, while
minimum thickness occurs at the top and bottom of the bottle.
The thickness tends to be uniform in the middle section, in
agreement with earlier studies of the parison during process-
ing. Density and crystallinity distributions are closely as-
sociated with the distribution of thickness and its effect on the
cooling rates prevailing during molding. Frozen stresses and
birefringence are largest at the outer surface, where cooling
rates are highest. The impact strength is lowest near the parting
line. Photomicrographs suggest that this is associated with
internal flow and crystallization phenomena."
INTRODUCTION,"Commercial bottles must satisfy performance criteria
Crna are compatible with the intended application of
the bottles. However, it is well known that blow-
molded polyethylene bottles exhibit a significant varia-
tion in thickness from point to point. Associated with
this thickness distribution, there are observable distri-
butions of mechanical and permanence characteristics.
These distributions are the direct result of the
thermo-mechanical history of the resin during the vari-
ous stages of the blow molding process.
The limited amount of reported work in the area of
ultimate properties of blow-molded articles (1-6) repre-
sents attempts to correlate empirically some property
(in some cases, not very wel] defined) of the blow-
molded article (e.g., haze, drop-impact resistance,
shrinkage, “appearance,” etc.) to operating conditions
(e.g., extrusion rate, temperature, blow pressure, etc.)
and to some resin parameters (e.g., melt index or resin
density). The thermo-mechanical history and the mi-
crostructure, which have not heretofore been investi-
gated, represent the necessary links between resin
properties, operating conditions, and ultimate bottle
properties.
In the following discussion, we summarize some of
the results of an experimental program designed to
study the distribution of thickness, crystallinity, den-
sity, impact properties, and birefringence in blow-
molded polyethylene bottles. The data will be
analyzed in relation to the thermo-mechanical history
experienced by the material during the molding pro-
cess."
EXPERIMENTAL,"A commercial blow-molding grade, high-density
polyethylene resin, designated as Resin D, was em-
ployed in the study. The density of Resin D was 0.960
g/cm³ with melt index of 0.40.
The variation of shear viscosity with shear rate and
temperature for Resin D was determined employing
both the Instron Capillary Rheometer and the Rheo-
metrics Mechanical Spectrometer. The results for 200
and 225 C are shown in Fig. 1. In addition to shear
viscosity, the capillary extrudate swell] of the material,
B(t), was measured as a function of time and tempera-
ture, in conjunction with the Instron Capillary Rheom-
eter and a specially designed attachment to minimize
the effects of drawdown (gravity) and cooling. The re-
sults are shown in Fig. 2. The significance of the above
and other rheological properties in relation to the
blow-molding behavior of the material will be the sub-
ject of another report. Information regarding the details
of the apparatus and experimental procedure may be
found elsewhere (7).
An Impco, model A13-R12, reciprocating screw-ex-
trusion blow-molding machine was employed in con-
junction with a commercial bottle mold possessing a
uniform cylindrical cavity. The cylindrical section of
the cavity had a diameter of 8 cm and alength of 20cm.
Extrusion temperature was set at 200°C and blow
pressure at 0.62 M Pa. The mold temperature was 13°C,
and the extrusion speed was monitored to be 45 g/s.
The blow-molded samples were cut so that the cylin-
drical sections of the bottles were separated. The sepa-
rated cylindrical sections were further cut along one of
the parting lines yielding a flat sheet. The cylindrical
sections were further divided into 24 vertical strips,
each 1 cm in length. The thickness distributions were
determined over 1 cm intervals from top to bottom,
employing a micrometer. The average density at various
positions was determined employing a density gradient
column. In order to determine density distribution in
the thickness direction, samples cut at various positions
in the bottle were microtomed using a microtome man-
ufactured by Reichert. For reference, three coordinate
axes were defined as indicated in Fig. 3. The x-axis
represents the axis of the cylindrical bottle, the y-axis is
in the direction of the cut and flattened circumferences,
and the z-axis is in the direction of the thickness of the
bottle.
The crystallinity and the birefringence distributions
of the microtomed samples between the outer and inner
surfaces of the moldings were determined in the y-z
plane. The birefringence experiments were carried out
employing a Reichert “Zetopan Pol” polarization micro-
scope, in conjunction with a rotary compensator with
quartz combination plates, manufactured by Ehring-
haus. The morphology of the samples, microtomed in
the x-y and x-z planes, was investigated and photo-
graphed under polarized light employing the Reichert
polarized microscope.
For impact tests, the cylindrical sections of the
blow-molded samples were divided uniformly into six
rectangular sections with dimensions of 8 - 10cm”. Two
of the test locations coincided with the parting line. The
impact properties of the samples were determined em-
ploying the High Speed Impact Tester recently de-
veloped by Rheometrics, Inc., employing various
cross-head speeds."
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION,"A typical three-dimensional thickness distribution of
the cylindrical sections of the blow-molded samples is
shown in Fig. 3. The thickness is greatest at and around
Time , min RESIN D the parting lines (e.g., Positions 6 and 12), and it varies
substantially along these lines. The minimum thickness
is observed to occur at the top and bottom portions of
various positions, excluding the parting lines and their
vicinity. With respect to circumferential distributions,
thickness varies significantly along the top and bottom
portions of the cylindrical sections from a maximum at
the parting lines to a minimum at Positions 4 and 9,
which are situated at 90° from the plane of the parting
lines. At other positions, located 4-16 cm from the top of
the cylindrical section, the thickness is more uniform
and does not vary significantly along the circumference.
The variation of bottle thickness may be related to
observed variations in the parison during extrusion (7-9)
and inflation (10, 11).
Typical distributions of average density at various
locations around the circumference are shown in Fig. 4.
The density varies considerably around the circumfer-
ence. The maximum values of density are observed at
the parting lines where the thickness is maximum. The
relationship between the thickness and density distri-
butions in blow-molded samples is illustrated in Fig. 5.
The density appears to increase linearly with thickness.
The increase of the density with increasing thickness
may be attributed to the lower rates of cooling as-
sociated with thicker specimens, since lower cooling
rates permit higher levels of crystallinity (7). This be-
havior emphasizes the very important role of thickness
control in extrusion blow-molded parts.
The distribution of crystallinity between the outside
and inside surfaces of the blow-molded specimens at a
position with a thickness of 1.6 mm is shown in Fig. 6.
Crystallinity increases from a minimum at the outside
surface, where the polymer contacts the mold cavity
surface during the cooling stage, to a maximum close to
the inside surface. The variation of crystallinity be-
tween the two surfaces should again be mainly in-
fluenced by the prevailing cooling rates during the cool-
ing stage (7).
It should be noted that the material at or close to the
outside surface, which solidifies immediately, should
retain the orientation arising from the previous defor-
mation history, while the material at or close to the
inner surface has available a substantially longer dura-
tion of time for the relaxation of orientation under more
favorable thermal conditions. As shown in Fig 7, optical
anisotropy or birefringence indeed generally increases
from a maximum at or close to the outer surface to a
minimum at or close to the inner surface of the blow-
molded articles. Moreover, it has been observed that
birefringence is greater for higher blow pressures and
lower extrusion temperatures. These observations are
related to the effects of pressure and temperature on
the frozen-in hoop stress in the molded bottles. Higher
face.
blow pressures result in higher strain rates during infla-
tion, as demonstratedin Fig. 8. The strain rate, é(t), has
been based on experimental cinematographic data ob-
tained during the inflation stage, and it is defined as
follows:
é(t) = dD₂(t)/dt = 1/D₂(t)
where D,(t) represents the measured outside diameter
at time t during inflation. Also, higher blow pressures
must be associated with larger hoop stresses, T(z, t),
defined at height, z, and time, t, as follows:
T(z, t) = PR(z, t) / b(z, t)
where P is the blow pressure, R is the radius, and b is
the thickness of the parison. The role of the lowering of
temperature is to raise the effective extensional viscos-
ity of the material, which again should contribute to
raising the hoop stresses.
Typical variations of the values of the impact energy
at yield, Ey, and impact energy at break, Eu, normal-
ized with respect to the thickness of various positions
tested, is shown in Fig. 9. The only statistically sig-
nificant variation in properties is observed when the test
locations coincide with the parting lines (positions des-
ignated with PL). At the parting lines, the energy at
break and yield is significantly lower than at other po-
sitions.
Photomicrographs of samples, which were micro-
tomed perpendicular to the bottle axis at various po-
sitions around the circumference of blow-molded sam-
ples, are shown in Fig. 10. Dark bands were observed at
both parting lines due to the squeezing flow of the
parison during clamping of the mold. Furthermore,
there are arc-shaped flow lines, which appear to be
composed of brighter and larger irregular-shaped
spherulites, in the vicinity of the parting lines. The

and the irregularly-shaped spherulites may result in the
lower values of impact strength of the samples at these
positions, as shown in Fig. 9."
CONCLUSIONS,"The results of this study suggest that, in the absence
of careful control schemes, the thickness of extrusion
blow-molded articles varies considerably both in the
axial and circumferential directions. Such variation may
Anisotropy and Dimensions of Blow-Molded Polyethylene Bottles
be attributed to phenomena occurring during the pari-
son-formation, clamping, and inflation stages. The pre-
vailing thickness distribution during the blow-molding
process leads to variations in cooling rates and, conse-
quently, to variations in the distribution of density
(crystallinity), birefringence (orientation), and ultimate
properties. Moreover, it is found that the material at the
parting line exhibits low-impact strength associated
with morphological and orientation characteristics that
are significantly different from those observed at other
positions in the blow-molded article."
