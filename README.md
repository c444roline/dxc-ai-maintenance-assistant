# DXC AI Maintenance Assistant

## Overview
The DXC AI Maintenance Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist water bottle manufacturers in identifying and troubleshooting problems with their bottles, machinery, and production processes. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and preprocessed manual data, the assistant offers real-time advice based on textual input.

### Future Vision
In future iterations, we hope to incorporate computer vision to visually identify issues in manufacturing, enhancing its ability to solve real-time production problems.

## Features

- **Problem Identification**: Identifies issues with bottles, machinery, and production processes.
- **Troubleshooting Assistance**: Provides actionable advice based on historical maintenance data and technical manuals.
- **Contextual and Accurate Responses**: Uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to find relevant solutions from a large corpus of preprocessed text data.
- **Real-time Problem Solving**: Instant responses that improve efficiency in maintenance operations.

## How It Works

1. **Input Handling**: Users describe problems with bottles or machinery.
2. **Data Processing**: Technical manuals and historical data are preprocessed for easy querying.
3. **AI-Driven Diagnosis**: The assistant uses **LangChain**, **BERT Embedding Model** **Hugging Face models**, and **OpenAI's GPT** for diagnosing issues and suggesting solutions.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Computer Vision Integration**: The chatbot will soon analyze images from the production line to identify defects and machinery issues.

## Usage

 Simply ask the assistant about bottle or machinery problems, and it will use the preprocessed data to provide a solution.

### Example queries:

- "Why is my bottle leaking?"
- "The machine is overheating, how can I fix this?"
