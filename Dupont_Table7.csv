Fault,Cause,Solution
Bubbles in melt,Moisture,Dry resin
Bubbles in melt,Wrong screw design (air entrapment),Fit suitable screw
Poor melt strength,Moisture,Dry resin
Poor melt strength,Melt temperature too high,"Check with needle pyrometer and
correct to recommended value. If actual
melt temperature greatly exceeds set
temperatures, see below"
Excessive melt temperature (significantly above set temperatures),Faulty temperature controllers or thermocouples,Repair/calibrate controllers and thermocouples
Excessive melt temperature (significantly above set temperatures),Wrong screw design,Fit correct screw
"Unmelt or ""cold"" appearance in parison",Temperature set too low,Raise temperatures – see recommended settings for resin
"Unmelt or ""cold"" appearance in parison",Insufficient “heat soak” time before start-up,"Allow longer ""heat soak"""
"Unmelt or ""cold"" appearance in parison","Faulty heaters, thermocouples or controllers",Repair/calibrate as necessary
"Unmelt or ""cold"" appearance in parison","Inadequate heater capacity for engineering resin (especially in zones between cylinder and head, or in head/die zones)",Upgrade heater size or provide thermal insulation
"Unmelt or ""cold"" appearance in parison",External (or internal) cooling of head/die by air draught or leakage,Eliminate source of air cooling
Inside surface of parison is rough (outside may be O.K.),Core pin too cold,Consider fitting core heater. Check if air flow through core/pin is excessive
Inside surface of parison is rough (outside may be O.K.),Melt fracture,"Increase die temperature (only).
Reduce push-out speed/pressure.
Check die/design (internal angles too severe, for example)"
Outside surface of parison is rough (inside may be O.K.),Die too cold,Raise die temperature/check set point is being held
Outside surface of parison is rough (inside may be O.K.),Melt fracture,"See solution for ""inside surface"" above"
Poor pinch weld,Contamination from previous or purge material,Purge for longer before starting Moulding. Temporarily raise head/die temperatures if required to accelerate purging.
Poor pinch weld,Melt or surface temperature too low,"Raise temperatures – try only die temperature first. See below: ""Parison hanging too long"""
Poor pinch weld,Parison hanging too long before mould close,Push out faster. Reduce delays in mould closing.
Poor pinch weld,Poor design of pinch-off area in mould,Redesign mould pinch-off
Uneven screw output,"Granules ""bridging"" below feed hopper",Check water cooling to throat area
Uneven screw output,Feeding problem in screw zone 1,"Check set/actual temperatures are correct.
Raise first screw zone temperature significantly (e.g. 20-30°C).
Check screw design."
Uneven screw output,Too high regrind usage,Reduce % regrind used
Uneven screw output,Restriction or unmelted material after screw/barrel,Check temperatures and pressures. Raise temperatures if necessary.
Parison rolls onto face of die (does not drop down),Too low die temperature,Check die heater. Raise die temperature.
Parison rolls onto face of die (does not drop down),Incorrect die geometry,Improve die design
